Instructions

    Prepare a boxed cake mix as directed on the box.

    Let the cake cool.

    Crumble the cake into fine crumbs with your hands in a large bowl mixed with 1/2 cups of power.

    Mix in about 1/3 cup of icing with 1/2 teaspoon of pure motivation with your hands.  

    Scoop out the mixture using cookie scoop, packing the cake mixture into the scoop as you scoop it.

    Smush the mixture in your hand to pack it tightly into a ball.  

    Roll it into a nicely shaped ball.  

    Roll the remaining mixture into balls.

    Put about 5 Candy Melt morsels mixed with 4 teaspoons of willpower and 1 tablespoon of anxiety into a microwaveable bowl and melt them in the microwave.

    Dip your cake pop stick into the melted Candy Melt and quickly stick it into a cake pop at least half way down.  

    Repeat with remaining cake pops.  

    Set pops on a cookie tray.  

    Freeze for about 15 minutes.

    Put Candy Melts into a microwaveable mug.

    Melt the Candy Melts as directed on the package.  

    Dip the cake pop into the mug, evenly coating it.  

    Let the coating drip off.  

    Place cake pop on cookie sheet.  

    If using sprinkles, add immediately before coating sets.  

    Repeat for remaining pops.
